# android-osmDroidDemo

This demo uses osmDroid(https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid) 
&
OSMMapTilePackager(https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid/tree/master/OSMMapTilePackager).

Try with values from https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid/tree/master/OSMMapTilePackager
the size will be large
you can also input your own values for north,  west, south, east.

Feel free to look at the project and make changes accordingly if you think there should be some fix and send a pull request.

This project is during my learning osmDroid. Will be working with navigation in next updates.
